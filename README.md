There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of [MSAL Node](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-node). Check it out:

* [Express web app sample authenticating users with Azure AD using MSAL Node](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-node)

If you really need to access this sample, you can navigate to the master branch, but please know that it's no longer maintained.
